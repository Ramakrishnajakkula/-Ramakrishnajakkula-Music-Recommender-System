Music Recommendation System

Overview

The Music Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application that provides personalized song recommendations to users based on their preferences and song similarities. This project aims to enhance user experience by offering tailored recommendations that align with individual tastes in music.

Features

Personalized Recommendations: The system analyzes user preferences and identifies similar songs to recommend based on their listening history.
Data Visualization: Utilizes visualizations such as t-SNE plots and distribution plots to explore the dataset and understand underlying patterns.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends songs based on both textual (e.g., song names) and numerical (e.g., acoustic features) attributes using cosine similarity metrics.
Evaluation Metrics: Evaluates the performance of the recommendation system using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Scalable: Capable of handling large datasets and scalable for real-time recommendation generation.
